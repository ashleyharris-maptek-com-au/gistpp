This is an executable that can be used to format SCAD files. 

It uses [a library](scad-format-dll.gistpp) to do formatting.

# Behavior:

- Similar command line arguments to clang-format.
- searches for .scad-format files in the same directory as the file to format, and in parent directories, until it finds one.
- can process via stdin, or a file, or a directory. 
- has a recursive argument to process directories recursively.
